Summary: Most of you might agree with me on this one, that there's always someone in your life whom you love very much, but cannot be with. And whoever you'll meet, whatever you'll do, nothing would like it would be with that one.

Yup, i quoted that from [this 9gag repost](http://9gag.com/gag/a8WpmeV). Since i don't watch HIMYM, i omitted the Robin part, but still, the context apply.

In my case, there is one.  
That person basically creates who i am right now.  
That person is whom i comfortable with.  
That person takes relativity to another level when i am with her.  
That person, deep down in my temple i know, is the one i can never be with.  

There it goes, 3 months without a single post, ended with an __alay__ post.  
Whatever.
